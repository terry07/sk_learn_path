# 📚 Articles to Read

A curated list of articles and interesting reads from my `SK_learn`-ing path.


Welcome to a handpicked collection of insightful articles and thought-provoking reads that have shaped my learning path during the last period and beyond. 🧠✨

This list features blogs and articles by experts and practitioners who dive into both fresh and classic topics, challenge popular (and unpopular) opinions, explain state-of-the-art techniques, or conduct fair and thorough benchmarking across a variety of methods. These resources are not only accessible but also spark meaningful discussions and feedback. 🔍💬

I will be continuously updating this list with new gems that catch my radar📡 and are worth sharing with the community. 🚀
